The Code presented is part of my master thesis. To explain the implications of the code I add the abstract of my thesis.

Abstract:
This paper investigates the concept of "innovation unions" – a collaborative approach between countries to coordinate industrial policies for innovation. Prior work has identified large efficiency gains from supranational coordination of innovation policy because of the strong international nature of knowledge spillovers. Yet, the fact that coordination problems make some unions infeasible in practice is ignored. Here, I measure the feasibility of a union between a given set of countries based on three dimensions: (1) Trade dependency, (2) Geopolitical alignment, and (3) Inequality of resource allocation under the optimal subsidy scheme. Findings reveal a tradeoff between a union’s feasibility and its return on subsidy investment, which emphasizes the value of overcoming feasibility challenges with coordination mechanisms. Additionally, I find that US membership to any union strongly contributes to these benefits, but that the US itself also strongly benefits from collaboration. The study offers valuable insight for policymakers, promoting data-driven decision-making for more efficient incentive allocation to foster innovation.
